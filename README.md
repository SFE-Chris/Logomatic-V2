The Logomatic is a great data logger that appears as a flash drive on any operating system. Logs are created
in FAT32 format on the microSD media and can be downloaded quickly over a USB connection by dragging and dropping 
the text files from the device. The board has a built-in RTC and 10 available GPIO pins.
